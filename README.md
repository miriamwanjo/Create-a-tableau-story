# Create-a-tableau-story
Data visualization using tableau
The dataset I chose contains information on flight delays for major airline carriers across all airports in the United States in August, 2018. For the visualization project, I focused on Dallas/Fort worth Airport mainly because I reside in Dallas and I wanted to narrow my area of focus given the vastness of the data. I aimed at answering three questions; how many aircrafts were delayed at the airport, how many minutes in total were wasted due to these flight delays, and the impact on the delays in terms of total cost.
